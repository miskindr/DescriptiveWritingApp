# Overview

In this app I was tring to accomplish a way for a student who wants to increase his writing ability do so in a easy manner.

The app is simple to use you open it up and there are two buttons one will generate a new random photo that is displayed and the other opens another screen that allows you to write about what you saw in a descriptive way. This can help a writer get their mind working and ready to write or a good excercise to see how desciptive you can be with what you saw.
